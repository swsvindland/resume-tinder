# Resume Tinder

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What is this app for
This app is a proof of concept for another tool that I am building and I wanted to test out the T3 stack. This app is a resume tinder where you can swipe left or right on resumes and it will save the results to a database. The idea is that you can use this to filter out resumes that you don't want to look at and then you can look at the ones that you swiped right on..
